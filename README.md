# kill-vegetarian-dinosur
A HTML canvas game built using JavaScript

I built this game during my first semester at Langara, as a project for Web Programming course.

To play this game:<br/>
  The game will start once you do the following step<br/>
  Drag the apple backwards while holding the left mouse button and release.<br/>
  You need to hit the dinosaur atleast 5 times to kill it.<br/>
  If the apple touches the ground, the game will alert you a message.<br/>
  Try to drag and not click.<br/>
  
The game uses a fixed length canvas. If it appears smaller or larger, then zoom in or zoom out as needed. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Access this game through this <a href='http://mylinux.langara.bc.ca/~j22/webprogramming-project/' target="_blank">link</a> and enjoy!!
